  <h1> JavaScript 1 </h1>
  <p> When we make a webpage, JavaScript can go into a &lt;script&gt; tag. One big part of JavaScript is called
    "imperative programming." This means that you are creating commands telling the computer what to do. The first
    "command" we will learn is </p>
  <p>
    <code> document.write("Hello"); </code>
  </p>

  <p>P.S. (The proper way to say "command" is "statement". JavaScript programs are composed of a series of JavaScript
    "statements")</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p> Let's start with some examples!</p>
  <script>
    document.write("Hello from JavaScript! ");
    document.write("I am telling you... ");
    document.write("don't forget the quotation marks! ");
    document.write("Every single letter and character is important. ");
    document.write('Very important. ');


  </script>

  <h3>You try it!</h3>
  <p>Now you try! Fill out the 3 <code>document.write();</code> statements below with your own text. Then write 5 more
    statements of your own, for a total of 8! </p>
  <script>
   
    document.write("Hope that all is well...");
    document.write("I'm learning alot! How about you?");
    document.write("I'm hoping that Java is simple and fun,");
    document.write("To be honest, learning a new skill or trade is always fun to me.");
    document.write("Most people I know, when asked a question, break-down when the question asked involves thought.");
    document.write("Therefor, I haven't many friends; I am an enigma in there eyes.");
    document.write("Why are you talking about science, math, politics, or religion when all there is is entertainment? They would often imply.");
    document.write("Because the worlds were framed via the knowledge, understanding, and wisdom of math, science, religion, and politics. I would often reply.");
    document.write("SO, I have a very small circle only because its getting harder and harder to find ppl after you on kind, 'Those whom have the ability to think for themselves, troubleshoot, and problem solve.");
    document.write("Enjoy the rest of your day, drink water, and stay safe!");
